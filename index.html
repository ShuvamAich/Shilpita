            <!--
            <p>Birthdays are a big deal as other than getting older. Your love is like a solid, unchanging rock. Thank you for always being there for me. 
            Being with you is the best feeling ever. Getting old may come with mixed feelings. I assure you that the best thing about it is that you grow wiser. 
            Words would never do justice to how precious you are to me. Happy birthday to you, may all your beautiful dreams come true.</p>
            -->
            <p>Thank you for making me smile even on my worst days. I am proud of how hard you are working on yourself. 
            Its weird how I can actually feel the pain in my chest and stomach, the pain of falling out with the person whom I thought I'd be with forever.
            I guess its true - "After love, no one is what they are before". Its so weird thinking back to when we first met and how much impact we had on eachother.
            I crave for the side of you that you did not show to anyone else. Things were falling into place - my office got shifted to Technopolis, we could have met every single day.
            I now get extra cash for food every month, we could have gone on dates every month. I wish we could have been a little more patient with ourselves. Its like the universe wanted us to be together,
            but we gave up on ourselves. It feels so empty without you, life in this city will no longer be the same. I hope we will be happy again. Let us forgive ourselves, not just once but again and again; as many times it requires to find peace.
            You have the power to make people happy and the world needs more of that. Do the things that scare you and everything will fall into place.
            Be sensitive. Be patient when you are hurt, it takes time to heal. Be careful with how much you tolerate. Be the best version of yourself, be you.
            Happy 20th Birthday.
